# Mathematics Semester Report
Camelot Academy &ast; 809 Proctor St &ast; Durham, NC 27707

A comprehensive battery of pretests was administered at the beginning of
the academic year to determine the student's current level of knowledge,
mastery, and capability. From this preassessment, an appropriate course of
study was laid out for your student. Please note that your student may
(based on pretesting) be reviewing some material already seen in a previous
academic year; this is not unusual, and an important part of the
mastery-based learning process.
