~~Inserting Chapters should have their Chapter titles autogenerated if
they don't exist.~~ I think this happens.

~~Deleting `Chapter`s should fail if any students have them as goals.~~

~~Likewise, deleting a `Course` should fail if any of its `Chapter`s would
fail to be deleted.~~

Slightly more granular "refreshment" and "repopulation" after altering
`User`s, `Course`s, and `Chapter`s, instead of just rereading and
resending _everything_.

~~Generate random passwords on insertion of new users.~~

~~Admin and Teacher HTML pages need browser currency check to make sure
Dialog::showModal() works.~~

~~User names, names, course titles, and chapter titles may not contain
the characters `&"<>`.~~

~~Widen "course symbol" input field in Admin's Edit Goal dialog.~~

Needs a "nuke all the students" button.

A single Academic Year should be able to contain days from multiple
calendar "pages".
